questions
You are given a CSV containing two fields:
Heading/Subheading name
The extracted content under that heading

Task:
Identify which entries correspond to actual user interface (UI) screens, pages, tabs, or popups.
Use both the heading name and the content to decide.
Ignore entries that are only descriptions, guidelines, requirements, or non-UI documentation.

For each identified UI entry, generate:
The exact name of the screen/tab/popup (clean, human-readable).
A detailed summary (2â€“3 sentences) describing its purpose and the main elements it displays, inferred only from the heading and its content.
Do not include any headings, guidelines, or extra formatting (like quotes, bullet points, or markdown) in the output.

Output must be in this exact CSV format:
Screen Name | Summary
