You are a UX/UI engineer. I had provided functional requirements and user interactions below. 
Based on them, generate a self-contained HTML file (with embedded <style> CSS) for a web/app. 
Do NOT produce wireframes â€” return valid HTML+CSS code.

Guidelines:
- Style: Modern
- Platform: Web, Mobile
- Every screen/page must be wrapped in a <section id="screen-name"> ... </section>
- Only one <section> is visible at a time using the :target CSS selector; others are hidden.
- Components: forms, input fields, buttons, tables with sample data, dashboards, cards, modals.
- Highlight key user interactions (click, hover, drag-drop, etc.).
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes for accessibility.

Expected Output:
- A single complete HTML file with embedded CSS
- One <section id="..."> per screen, with unique ids for navigation
- Navigation flow implemented with anchor links and :target CSS
- Responsive, accessible, and visually styled UI mockups

Requirements:
Incidents
The Incidents screen allows users to view incidents and tickets, likely sourced from a system like ServiceNow.
