• Tabs Navigation:
Horizontal tabs at the top, including:
o Support Instructions (Default tab) 
o Job Plans (Selected tab) 
o Run Statistics 
o Incidents 
o Change Requests 
• Search Field:

17
DIG-ITS FRD
B. Job Plan Table
The table will display the following columns:
1. Job Plan
a. The name of the job plan (e.g., WCR JOBP1000_GLOBAL_PC). 
b. The name should be a clickable hyperlink that directs users to the job plan's detailed
page. 
2. Description
a. A short description of the job plan (e.g., WCR Global Policy and claim processing). 
3. Environment
a. A list of the environments associated with the job plan, displayed with color codes.
i. Green: Successfully executed. 
ii. Red: Pending or in progress. 
4. Last Modified Date
a. The date and time when the job plan was last modified (e.g., 03-Mar-2025 00:50:10). 
b. The date should be displayed in a readable, formatted way and should be sortable by
clicking the column header. 
5. Pagination
a. The table should support pagination to display a limited number of job plans per page
(e.g., 10 records per page). 
b. Users should be able to navigate between pages using page numbers or previous/next
buttons.
C. Environment Filter
A filter dropdown should be provided to allow users to filter job plans based on the environment 
(e.g., All, Dev, Cert, Prod). This should dynamically update the displayed list based on the selected 
environment.
IV. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
A. Dynamic Content Loading
• The job plans list must dynamically load based on the selected filters and search criteria. 
• Changing filters or search criteria must update the job plan list without reloading the entire
page.
B. Sorting
• Each column in the job plan table (Job Plan, Description, Environment, Last Modified Date)
should be sortable by clicking on the column header. 
• Sorting should be both ascending and descending.
18
DIG-ITS FRD
C. Hyperlink Behavior
• Clicking on the job plan name (under the "Job Plan" column) should open the Job Plan Detail
Page in the same window/tab. 
• The job plan name should be a hyperlink, clearly distinguishable by a different style (e.g.,
underline or color).
D. Search Functionality
• Users should be able to search job plans by name, description, or environment using the search
bar at the top-right. 
• The search should be case-insensitive and support partial text matches.
E. Environment Status Display
• The Environment column will display color-coded status indicators:
o Green: Successful execution in the environment. 
o Red: Pending execution or processing.
F. Pagination
• The job plan list should be paginated, displaying a maximum of 10 job plans per page. 
• Pagination controls (e.g., page numbers, "Next", "Previous") should be clearly visible and easy
to use.
G. Filtering by Environment
• Users should be able to filter the job plans by the environment using a dropdown filter (e.g., All,
Dev, Cert, Prod). 
• The page should dynamically update the job plan list based on the selected environment.
V. UI/UX REQUIREMENTS
• Responsive Design:
The layout should be responsive and adapt to various screen sizes. 
• Table Design:
The job plan table should have a clear, card-based layout with well-defined rows and columns. 
 The environment status color-coding should be visually distinct to quickly convey the job status. 
• Hover/Click Interactions:
o The job plan name (under the Job Plan column) should be clearly indicated as a clickable
element (e.g., hover effect, underline). 
o Hovering over the environment status should show a tooltip or additional information (e.g.,
"Execution successful in Dev environment").
19
DIG-ITS FRD
• Search Box and Filters:
The search field and environment filter should be easily accessible at the top of the page for quick 
navigation.
VI. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
• Security:
Users must be authorized to access job plan data, with access control implemented to restrict 
visibility to authorized users only. 
• Performance:
The job plan list should load quickly, even when filtering by different environments or applying 
search criteria. 
• Error Handling:
The system should handle errors gracefully, such as when no job plans match the search criteria or 
filters, displaying a message like "No results found."
