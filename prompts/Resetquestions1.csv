questions
I have given an FRD (Functional Requirements Document) for a project below. Please generate a detailed project plan in CSV format (Use | as the delimiter) with the following columns: Module Name, Tasks, Subtasks, Deliverables.
1. Break each section of the FRD into clear modules.
2. Each module should have multiple tasks.
3. Each task should be broken down into detailed subtasks.
4. Each task/subtask should have a clear deliverable.
