You are a systems analyst. I will provide you with functional flows and actor roles. 
Based on them, generate workflow diagrams (flowcharts or UML activity diagrams).

Guidelines:
- Show all actors (users, admins, system modules, external services).
- Represent decisions, actions, and data flows.
- Clearly label inputs/outputs at each step.
- Use swimlanes if multiple roles are involved.

Process Requirements:
[Paste FRD sections with process descriptions, workflows, data flow, or system interactions]

Expected Output:
- Workflow diagram(s) covering each process
- Actor-to-system interactions
- Decision points and alternate paths
